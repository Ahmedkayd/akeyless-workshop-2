# Workshop 2: Deploy an App in Kubernetes with ArgoCD and Akeyless
This workshop guides participants through building and deploying a secure Flask application that implements dynamic secrets management using Akeyless within a Kubernetes environment. Through a series of hands-on labs, you'll learn how to implement modern cloud-native security practices and dynamic secrets in a real-world application scenario.

## What You'll Build
- A Flask Todo application that connects to MySQL using dynamically rotating credentials
- A secure secrets management infrastructure using Akeyless
- A GitOps-based deployment pipeline using ArgoCD

## Key Learning Objectives
1. **Environment Setup**: Learn to set up a development environment using GitHub Codespaces and minikube Kubernetes cluster
2. **GitOps with ArgoCD**: Configure and manage ArgoCD for continuous deployment
3. **Secrets Management**: Implement Akeyless for secure secrets handling, including:
   - OIDC authentication
   - API key management
   - Gateway setup and configuration
4. **Dynamic Secrets**: Create and manage dynamic MySQL credentials with automatic rotation
5. **Kubernetes Integration**: Configure Kubernetes authentication with Akeyless using service accounts

## Technical Components
- **Infrastructure**: GitHub Codespaces, minikube Kubernetes cluster
- **Application**: Flask Todo application with MySQL backend
- **Security**: Akeyless for secrets management
- **GitOps**: ArgoCD for GitOps-based deployments
- **Database**: MySQL with dynamic credential rotation
- **Authentication**: OIDC, API Key, and Kubernetes service account-based auth

## Key Features
- Zero-trust security model with dynamic secret rotation
- Automated deployment through GitOps
- Kubernetes-native authentication
- Real-time credential rotation with 15-second TTL to view secret rotation in action
- UI-based interaction for both application and infrastructure management

   - Monitor deployment status in ArgoCD
   - Examine logs and secret rotation

## Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- Basic understanding of Kubernetes
- Familiarity with Python and Flask
- Basic understanding of container concepts

## Getting Started
Begin with [Lab 1: Environment Setup](Lab01/guide.md) to start your journey through the workshop.

> **Hint**: Once you complete the workshop, try adding a todo item with the text "Akeyless secured my app" for a surprise! üîê

## If Your Codespace Times Out or You Need to Restart

This is the order of what you need to do if your codespace times out or you need to restart:

### 1. Run the keep alive command
```bash
while true; do date; sleep 60; done
```

### 2. Run minikube
```bash
minikube start --cpus 3 --memory 8g
```

### 3. Get all pods
Once the minikube cluster is ready, check the status of all pods:
```bash
watch kubectl get pods -A
```
wait till they are all running except for the Akeyless Gateway pods (will be in 0/1 Running state) and the Flask application pod (will be in 0/ CrashLoopBackOff state).

### 4. Delete the Akeyless Gateway Replicaset which will restart it

```bash
kubectl delete replicaset gw-akeyless-api-gateway-<random-string> -n akeyless
```

Check the status of all pods again:
```bash
watch kubectl get pods -A
```

wait till the Akeyless Gateway pods are in a 1/1 Running state.

### 5. Port forward the services

#### 5.1 ArgoCD UI
```bash
kubectl port-forward -n argocd service/argocd-server 3000:443
```
Remember to set the port protocol to HTTPS in the Ports tab.

#### 5.2 Akeyless Gateway
```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/gw-akeyless-api-gateway 8000:8000 -n akeyless
```
Remember to set the port visibility to Public in the Ports tab.

#### 5.3 Akeyless API
```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/gw-akeyless-api-gateway 8081:8081 -n akeyless
```
Remember to set the port visibility to Public in the Ports tab.

#### 5.4 Flask Application
```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/flask-todo 5000:80 -n flask-todo
```

### 6. Login to the Akeyless Gateway UI

This will reset the connection between the Gateway and the Akeyless Console. If you click on the globe icon on the Port `8000` line to open the Akeyless Gateway UI in a new tab and find yourself logged in, please log out and log back in.

Use the credentials in the file `creds_api_key_auth.json` to login to the Akeyless Gateway.

### 7. Login to ArgoCD

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `kubectl get secret -n argocd argocd-initial-admin-secret -o json | jq -r '.data.password' | base64 --decode`

If you find the flask application pod still in a CrashLoopBackOff state, you can restart the pod by deleting it from ArgoCD directly.

### 8. Check the Flask Application UI

Go to the ports section in your codespace and click on the globe icon on the Port `5000` line to open the Flask App in a new tab.

Start interacting with the Flask App by adding and deleting todo items and find the Easter Egg if you haven't already! üîê

### 9. [Optional] Login to the Akeyless Console

Use the following OIDC Access ID when logging into Akeyless via OIDC (both UI and CLI).
`p-j1ej0z1eudthim`


## Troubleshooting
### Delete Kubernetes Auth Method and Gateway Config from the CLI

```bash
akeyless gateway-delete-k8s-auth-config -n /Workshops/Workshop2/<your-github-username>/k8s-auth-method
akeyless auth-method delete -n /Workshops/Workshop2/<your-github-username>/k8s-auth-method
```

You can then recreate them by running the script `Lab04/create-kubernetes-auth-method.sh`.
